# Rusty Metal

This repo is a brief forray into learning how to get rust working in an embedded environment on bare metal. 

While C and C++ are relatively easy and common on embedded devices, the benefits of rust are pretty clear, especially when we start thinking about environments where safety is critical. 
Rust might not be the best tool for the job, but it's definitely shaping up to be something that solves many of the issues of C.
Yes, it's a little unsafe to use rust like this... but we do it with C anyways so let's see if it gives us any benefit. 

Anyways, I'll fill this out properly when I have more value to add. 
Cheers for now!
